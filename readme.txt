================================== RegTracker ==================================
 
    Hello registry hackers, this program was created in order to provide a
    tool for those who have the need of making any system changes via
    registry.
    Make a change in your system and RegTracker will help you to
    find out wich was the key whose values were modified within
    that change.
    The program works obtaining the last modified keys in the registry
    within a user-defined time range, giving the possibility of tracking
    the key you need.
 
    All data related to RegTracker's scans will be porperly stored so you
    can consult it any time.
    Use RegTracker's graphic interface to perform the scans and query the
    resulting data.
    This program uses SQLite DB Browser for advanced queries.
    Visit DB Browser webpage at: https://sqlitebrowser.org/
    Keep in mind that the depth of the scans will go as far as your
    rights over the registry.
